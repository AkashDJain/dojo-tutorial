# About

## Welcome to the Dojo Tutorial
The website was created because of lack of good introduction to the latest version of Dojo, also many things are not covered in the offical documentation. The tutorial will show how to deal with many real life scenarios of using Dojo widgets and how to create custom things.

The tutorial is open source, you can contribute to it by forking the project on github and sending pull request.
